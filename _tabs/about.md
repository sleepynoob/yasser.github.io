# Hello, I’m Yasser El Ayyachy

I received a Master in Computer Science Research as well as Engineering from the university of Rennes. I did my Master Thesis under the guidance of [David Guennec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D2X9_GQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Damien Lolive](https://people.irisa.fr/Damien.Lolive) on French Voice Cloning by adapting [VALL-E](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vall-e-x) and other similar Neural Codec Language Models.

## Research Interests

I am very passionate about theoretical Reinforcement Learning Sagety, specifically from the perspective of agent interruptibility and reward hacking.
